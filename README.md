# RPG Dungeon Starter Guide
This repository serves as the documentation for the rules-lite text-based roleplaying game system "RPG Dungeon". You can see the website's current home [here](http://rpgdungeon.epicgamer.org). 

## How did we get here?
One of my friends made the system up in 2019 on a lark because he liked turn-based video games. It quickly got overcomplicated, as poorly-defined game systems tend to do. While those of us who'd been around since the early days didn't have any problems, we were having a harder and harder time explaining anything to newcomers interested in joining. To that end, I made a (long) Google Doc starter guide to help introduce people, sent it to said friend, and promptly forgot about updating it.

Fast forward to July 2022. I'm taking a web development college course over the summer, and my final project is to build a website about anything I like. There's a few crucial requirements, though:

- I need 8-12 pages.
- I need "enough text" and at least 6 images.
- I need a meaningful table and a list.
- I need to use forms to let visitors submit information, e.g., name, email address, comments, etc.
- I need to use JavaScript (JQuery) to make my website "interesting and alive".
- "Use your creativity to build this website".

The majority of what I do in my free time is play video games. Of the rest—writing, cooking, and *modding* video games—I didn't know if I could scrape together enough information for eight pages, and I certainly didn't want to have to spend all that time writing eight pages worth of content. As I was trying to come up with a topic I liked, I made a joke about picking RPG Dungeon to a friend. I then actually considered the idea: the text was mostly pre-written, I knew what I'd do for the table, and the Javascript bit would be easy enough. It became clear within about ten minutes that this was probably the best I was going to come up with.

By the time I finished the project, I'd written several hundred words' worth of original text about RPG Dungeon's mechanics and put together a website that, all things considered, didn't look terrible. After asking around and being told that yes, this was probably easier to digest than the seventeen-page long Google Doc, I decided to make it official. The site's not complete yet, but I'm satisfied enough with it to post here.

## Where can I play it?
RPG Dungeon's rules are available to the public, but unit details and the actual space where it's conducted are unfortunately private. I'm almost certainly not going to invite you to the server in question if you're finding out about it through this repository. Sorry!

## Can I help?
Probably not, but if you're interested in trying anyway, shoot me an email at yue206@gmail.com.
