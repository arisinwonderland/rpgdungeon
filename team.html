      <h2>Meet the RPG Dungeon Team</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">I want to speak to a manager.</p>
      <p>Here's a list of the lovely individuals who have done the most to make RPG Dungeon what it is today.</p>
      <h3>Zak</h3>
      <i>he/him</i><br>
      <img class="avatar" src="img/zak.png" title="Exclusive photo of Zak's dog. Do not steal.">
      <p>Zak is the founder of RPG Dungeon and is thus responsible for making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goku">Goku</a> beat up a pony. He is a fan of Fire Emblem, and is well-known for letting fun little one-off ideas spiral far out of control. We love him for it. He also created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_Rain_2">Risk of Rain 2</a> expansion pack.</p>
      <h3>Grey</h3>
      <i>they/them</i><br>
      <img class="avatar" src="img/grey.png" title="Cosmog official art © The Pokémon Company. Edit by Grey.">
      <p>Grey is your illustrious webmaster and writer of text galore. They wield the game balance hammer with extreme prejudice. Concept characters the world over tremble to hear their username. They're also a college student or something boring like that.</p>
      <h3>Xylo</h3>
      <i>he/him</i><br>
      <img class="avatar" src="img/xy.png" title="Art source: https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/79698203">
      <p>Xy is the guy who keeps RPG Dungeon moving along even when the rest of us have life commitments to ignore. He's the creative type, and has a host of unpublished character ideas to rival Zak's. He's responsible for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a> expansion, which has probably gained a new entry in the time it took you to read this bio.</p>
