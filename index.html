      <h2>"Wait, what the heck is an RPG Dungeon?"</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Don't worry, I'll explain it to you in excruciating detail.</p>
      <p>You might have been sent here because you talked about wanting to roleplay more. You might have asked one too many questions and gotten hit with the advertising spiel. You might even have had this thing you're not interested in sent to you with absolutely no prompting! If you're actually bothering to read this, though, let me explain exactly what you'd be getting yourself into if you join RPG Dungeon.</p>
      <p>RPG Dungeon is, to put it simply, <del>a mistake</del> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugen_(game_engine)">M.U.G.E.N</a> of text-based <abbr title="role-playing games">RPGs</abbr>. It's hosted as a part of the Discord roleplay server Hell as a sort of side project. Characters from all kinds of media gather here to combat the common threat of randomly generated enemies. We combine a mostly jokey atmosphere with a more serious overarching plot to create a one-of-a-kind experience. </p>
