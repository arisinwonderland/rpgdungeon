      <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Jolly cooperation!</p>
      <p>First and foremost, RPG Dungeon is balanced around a cooperative experience. <abbr title="player versus player">PvP</abbr> is extremely busted here because these characters are not made to fight each other (the vast majority of <abbr title="'one versus one', or a one-on-one battle">1v1s</abbr> can be won in a turn or less). If that's not for you, that's fine! You probably won't want to make a player character, though. <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> about the possibility of designing enemies or contributing plot elements, and we'll get you set up. You'll still probably want to read the rest of this website to familiarize yourself with the mechanics.</p>
      <p>Second off, most of what you'll be doing is combat. Roleplay is absolutely a thing here, but as stated earlier, it's not taken nearly as seriously as in Hell proper. This is a subworld, and is thus non-canonical to the rest of the server. We'd greatly appreciate it if you put in at least some effort, but you don't need to stress over it.</p>
      <p>Third, metagaming is almost always completely fine. The Bestiary is publicly viewable for a reason. Any monster or character there can be checked whenever you want to without a justification. You're also welcome to Google a monster name or similar if you want, though note that many things here are original creations and/or have been modified from their source material. The exception is if you have behind-the-scenes info on monsters, locales, or other fixtures of the dungeon that aren't in that document yet. Basically, don't use information that's not equally  available to everyone, but everything else is free game.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the DM's word is absolute. You're allowed to argue with them, of course, but ultimately you'll have to abide by their judgement. The DM is usually Zak, but others might take a turn as one occasionally. In that case, you'll have to obey whoever the current DM is, although Zak can still overrule them.</p>
      <p>Got all that and still want to play? Cool. Move on to the next page.</p>
