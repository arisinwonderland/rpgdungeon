      <h2>The World of RPG Dungeon</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">We live in a society.</p>
      <p>Your character will probably be arriving in a mysterious lobby (#dungeon-lobby, to be specific), having appeared there suddenly from wherever their home universe is. You've got the option to drop them directly into action as well, which you can discuss with Zak if you so wish. Everyone who's in the dungeon subworld arrived the same way from their own worlds. The lobby is located in the void between space and time, and there's no way to get back home as far as anyone here knows.</p>
      <p>The lobby's actual appearance varies; players have the freedom to decorate it as they wish. There's only a few permanent fixtures as of now. The main one is a number of monitors that display the events currently going on in the numbered #rpg-dungeon channels. They can also be rewound to play back old footage as desired. Additional rooms can be unlocked by finding blueprint items and returning them to the lobby.</p>
      <p>The other important fixture is a portal made by R, a mysterious bartender. It leads to what seems to be a blank white void where the only things in sight are other portals, each of which leads to a smallish personal room. You don't get one by default, but you can ask anytime R is there or ask to share with someone else. The portals only allow people through at any given time that the room's owner agrees to let through, and this can be changed freely or even on a case-by-case basis of entry attempts.</p>
      <p>The lobby is also a hub of sorts. From the lobby, you can instantly travel to a number of locales, listed in <a href="locales.html">Locales</a>. Each locale will contain different features and threats to contend with. They're all mostly combat-based, though, so if you go out there prepare to fight. To enter a locale, you'll need either a free #rpg-dungeon channel or an open slot in a party in a taken one. Six player characters is the maximum per party. If you die, you turn into a ghost that can be revived at a Fountain of Revival. This only works for player characters, so maybe don't mention to NPCs that you're unkillable. If your whole party dies, they all return to the lobby. You can also go back to the lobby at will to heal fully and remove all buffs and debuffs from yourself.</p>
      <p>The fourth wall is extremely shaky around here, though it does exist. Leaning on or breaking it is absolutely fine, if perhaps a bit frowned upon in more serious moments. You, the roleplayer, can also talk in the channels and be heard by whoever you want to let hear you, though you can't fight. Several things that exist in-world have no justification behind how they work besides “narrative convenience”. The RPG system itself is one of those things. Your characters are aware of it, but as for why it is the way it is, not even we have an answer.</p>
      <p>Finally, the RPG system is an actual thing that exists in-world, not just a storytelling device to illustrate combat. Your characters won't necessarily know everything about it the moment they drop in, but they'll be able to use and understand their abilities just fine from the get-go.</p>
