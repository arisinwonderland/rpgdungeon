      <h2>Character Creation</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Step 1: pick a character. Step 2: build the rest of the fucking character.</p>
      <p>If you're considering making a character, you'll probably want to ask Zak or Grey for a personal Dungeon channel. You don't need to actually use it, since we've long since stopped caring about having too many channels here. Alternatively, if you're afraid of commitment, you can just do it in <abbr title="direct messages">DMs</abbr>. Once you've chosen your preferred avenue of communication, feel free to ask us any questions you like. Once you're done, submit your final draft so we can check it over for balance and suggest any changes. We'll tell you when you're okay to post it to #rpg-conversion. You can change your characters at any time after submission by contacting one of us or pinging us in your channel. </p>
      <p>For ease of illustration, here's a generic character who isn't actually in the dungeon. Reference if you want to see how the information in the below sections translates to text, or if you want a base to start from when you build your own. Come back here anytime if you need to take another look at the full picture.</p>
