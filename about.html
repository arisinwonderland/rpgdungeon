      <h2>About RPG Dungeon</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">In case the main page wasn't enough of an explanation.</p>
      <p>RPG Dungeon had its humble beginnings in early 2019 when Zak, server owner of Hell, had the thought, "hey, wouldn't it be funny if I?". Since then, it's bloomed into a massive project spanning six chat channels and a total of over nineteen thousand messages to date. It also features two fan-made parody expansions based on the games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_Rain_2">Risk of Rain 2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV">Final Fantasy XIV.</a></p>
      <p>Dungeon takes inspiration from other established games and systems including but not limited to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem">Fire Emblem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate/Grand_Order">Fate/Grand Order</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon">Pok&eacute;mon</a>. Its core gameplay, though, is closest to a simplified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>. The combat is turn-based, and characters may roleplay freely between combat scenarios at the <abbr title="Dungeon Master, usually Zak">DM's</abbr> discretion.</p>
      <p>In terms of what characters can be played in RPG Dungeon, the sky's (more or less) the limit. We started with only Hell original characters, but we've expanded to allow canon characters from elsewhere or <abbr title="original characters">OCs</abbr> that haven't been published yet, so you don't actually need to participate in the rest of the server to be here.</p>
      <p>As for Hell itself, it's a generalist OC roleplaying server. The best way to find out more about that is just to participate! We don't bite.</p>
